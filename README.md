# Python_Challenge

## What am I trying to accomplish with this challenge? The first portion will be called the "PyBank" challenge.
In the "PyBank" challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a certain company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## The second portion of this challenge is called "PyRoll".
In the "PyRoll" challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

I will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

My final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
